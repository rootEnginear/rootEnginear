# 🦄&#xFE0F; Hello!

I am a 3rd-year computer-engineering student who is very attentive to every detail. Any untidy elements by any pixels cannot bypass my sharp, neat, eagle eyes. Still, I am friendly and reasonably rational. 👨‍💻️

## 🔮&#xFE0F; Technological Skills

I am proficient in HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js. I somewhat have experienced with SCSS, Firebase, SQL, UI/UX Designing, and Git. Also, I am familiar with TypeScript, React.js, and Node.js.

## 🕹&#xFE0F; My works
